# LinuxCurseGUI
This is a simple app for installing CurseForge modpacks on Linux. I didn't really make any design it just has the default design. If this doesn't work u can try my other project that was written in python but it didn't have a GUI: https://github.com/CustomCheat/LinuxCurse but i have to warn you because the older repository will maybe not receive updates and may not have the same features as this repository.
