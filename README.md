# LinuxCurseGUI
This is a simple app for installing CurseForge modpacks on Linux. I didn't really make any design it just has the default design. If this doesn't work u can try my other project that was written in python but it didn't have a GUI: https://github.com/CustomCheat/LinuxCurse but i have to warn you because the older repository will maybe not receive updates and may not have the same features as this repository.
Since on CurseForge website the linux support is only in the state of 'Coming Soon!' i wanted to renew my old project and rewrite it from scratch in Java.
